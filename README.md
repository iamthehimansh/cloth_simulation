# Cloth Simulation with SFML

### Forked from [https://github.com/FelipesCoding/cloth_simulation](FelipesCoding/cloth_simulation)

## Added Features
- Added a wind force to the cloth simulation
- Added the ability to apply force to particles by dragging with the mouse
- Added variable mass to particles and give them different colors based on their mass


## Description

This project is a cloth simulation implemented using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). 
It demonstrates basic cloth physics and rendering using SFML, which is a popular multimedia library for C++.

## Prerequisites

To compile this project you will need:

- **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** (for managing packages on macOS/Linux)
- **SFML** (installed via Homebrew - brew install sfml)

Otherwise change CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS in makefile.
